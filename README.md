# Ruby

Ruby is a programming language :)

## Version

`ruby 2.5.8p224 (2020-03-31 revision 67882) [x86_64-linux]`

## Tutorials

- [Ruby for Beginners by Mike - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ispmWmdjY)
- [Learning Ruby: From Zero to Hero - freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-ruby-from-zero-to-hero-90ad4eecc82d/)

I started to learn Ruby from Mike, then try solve challenge on codewars (after i googled them :hand_over_mouth:), and i'm currently on hackerrank.

My advice is perhaps you can try to start learning Ruby from these resources (freecodecamp or others), then improve on hackerrank and finally solve kata on codewars
- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Rank up from 8kyu to 1kyu, all the best! (make sure you know what you're doing)

Update: Maybe you can use both Hackerrank and Codewars at the same time (as long as they help you improve your proficiency of the language)
